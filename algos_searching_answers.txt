Question 1: What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
	There is a list name of students in a class. If a teacher wants to find a specific name, for instance "Emma", she has to look through the
name list from the top to the bottom to find "Emma."

Question 2: What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
	Finding a book in the library is an example of binary search. All books in the library are well arranged and sorted alphabetically.
We determine total number of racks and the middle rack. Then, we can ignore the first half of the racks or the second half, repeat the same process
until we find the book that we want. 

Question 3: Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
	7 iterations.

Question 4:Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
	3 iterations.

Question 5:Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Explain your reasoning.
	I would choose linear search because the collection is unsorted, so we had to check every item in the collection.


Question 6: Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Explain your reasoning.
	I would choose binary search because binary search is more efficient when the collection is sorted. And using binary search would help us 
to reduce the iteration to the half way.


Programming Assignment:

Question 1: You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. 
Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


        let words = ['World', 'Brother','Albatross', 'AA', 'World', 'Yes'];
        function findWord(list, word){
            list.sort();
            let start=0;
            let end= list.length-1;
            let middle = Math.floor((start+end)/2)
            while(list[middle]!== word && start<end){
                if(list[middle]>word){
                    end = middle-1
                }else{
                    start = middle+ 1;
                }
                middle = Math.floor((start+end)/2);
            }
            return (list[middle]!==word) ? -1: middle;

        }

        console.log(findWord(words, 'Albatross'));


Question 2: You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. 
Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

        let tank = ['black', 'white','white-spotted', 'red','yellow'];
        function findRightFish(tank, fish){
            for(let i =0; i<tank.length; i++){
                if(fish=== tank[i]){
                    return fish;
                }
            }
            return "not found";
            }

        console.log(findRightFish(tank, "w"));
